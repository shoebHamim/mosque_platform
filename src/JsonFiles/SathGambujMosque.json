    "description":"Sath Gambuj Mosque, is located in Bagerhat district, southern Bangladesh, within the Khulna Division. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the largest mosque in Bangladesh from the sultanate period (1352â€“1576). It was built during the Bengal Sultanate by Khan Jahan Ali, the governor of the Sundarbans. It has been described as 'one of the most impressive Muslim monuments in the whole of South Asia'. Although the name of the mosque implies that it has 60 domes, in reality it has 77 low domes arranged in seven rows of eleven, with an additional dome on each corner, bringing the total to 81 domes. The mosque also has 11 arched doorways on east and 7 each on north and south for ventilation and light, presenting a dark and somber appearance inside. Lastly, although the number of domes are not 60 but the number of columns of the mosque is actually 60.",
