    "description":"Bajra Shahi Mosque is an 18th-century mosque located in the Bazra Union under Sonaimuri Upazila of Noakhali District, Bangladesh. It has been described as the 'most notable historical monument' in the area around Maijdee. The mosque was built by Aman Ullah in 1741-42 during the reign of the Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah. Between 1911 and 1928, Bazra zamindars Khan Bahadur Ali Ahmad and Khan Bahadur Mujir Uddin Ahmad had it extensively repaired and decorated with mosaics made from colored shards of ceramic giving it a beautiful exterior. It is on the Bangladesh government's Department of Archaeology's list of protected sites.",
